This project used a decision list to predict the word sense of each line in a text. In this example, it tries to see if each line is referring to the word "phone" or the word "product". This is done by using training data to help create the decision list and then testing it on another set of text. The scorer file then outputs the confusion matrix and compares the accuracy of the test data with the key.
