This program was designed to generate random sentences from a text chosen by the user. The randomly generated sentences are selected by n-grams. This program only accepts command line arguments, in the format, "perl file_name (number of n-grams) (number of sentences to generate) input file(s)". An example of this would be, "perl ngram.pl 3 10 chosenText1.txt chosenText2.txt chosenText3.txt".
